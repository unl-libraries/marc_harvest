This package enables you to read existing MARC records from a file, string, or (using the YAZ extension), from a Z39.50 source. You can also use this package to create new MARC records.\n\nThis package is based on the PHP MARC package, originally called \"php-marc\", that is part of the Emilda Project (http://www.emilda.org).  Christoffer Landtman generously agreed to make the \"php-marc\" code available under the GNU LGPL so it could be used as the basis of this PEAR package."
